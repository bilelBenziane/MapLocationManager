# MapLocationManager
This is a component for Joomla (version 3.4  works fine) that has a back-end to create locations with details like phone number, email , addressâ€¦etc. and  front-end to display these locations.
-The zip file I included contains the first version of this component. I already finished another version but it still needs some adjustments. 
-The map I used contains only the list of states of Algeira (48 states) but if you follow the code carefully you will be able to use another map.
